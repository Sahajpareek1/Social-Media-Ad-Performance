# 📊 Meta Ad Performance Dashboard - SQL, Power BI

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI Dashboard designed for the comprehensive analysis and optimization of Meta (Facebook & Instagram) advertising campaigns. It transforms raw ad event data, campaign budget information, and user demographics into actionable insights across the entire marketing funnel—from impression to final purchase.

The goal is to provide media buyers and marketing managers with the necessary tools to track performance, assess campaign efficiency, and refine audience targeting.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track ad performance metrics across multiple Meta platforms.

- Understand engagement trends by gender, age, and country.

- Identify top-performing ad types and campaigns.

- Monitor click-through rate (CTR), engagement rate, and purchase rate.

- Evaluate the impact of ad budgets on overall campaign success.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

- SQL Server – Data extraction and transformation

- DAX – Calculated KPIs and advanced measures

- Excel/CSV Files – Data source (ad_events, ads, campaigns)

## 🧮 Required Data Sources

The dashboard requires the following four CSV files to be loaded into Power BI. They represent a simplified but complete ad ecosystem:

| File            | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ad_events.csv` | Contains all user interactions with ads                         |
| `ads.csv`       | Details of each advertisement (platform, ad type, demographics) |
| `campaigns.csv` | Campaign-level data including budgets and status                |
| `users.csv`     | User demographic and interest data for segmentation.            |
